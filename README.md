# stadia-resolution

Extend Stadia resolution outside the typical options. Choose between the unmodified Stadia stream, 1440p, or 4k.

## Why?
If you have a 1440p monitor, you may notice that Stadia keeps defaulting to 1080p. Using this extension will have Stadia switch to the 1440p or 4k stream.

## Installation instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
3. Enable `Developer mode`. This is a toggle on the top right of the page as of Chrome 80.
4. Click `Load unpacked` and select this repo's directory.
5. Enable `Stadia Resolution` and set your extension options.
