# stadia-resolution

Extend Stadia resolution outside the typical options. Choose between the unmodified Stadia stream, 1440p, or 4k.

## Why?
If you have a 1440p monitor, you may notice that Stadia keeps defaulting to 1080p. Using this extension will have Stadia switch to the 1440p or 4k stream.

## Installation instructions:
